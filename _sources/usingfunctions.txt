Using Functions for Fun and Profit
===================================

If you been paying attention, we have used functions several (the type
function, type converter functions, and the input function). While you
probably have an intuitive understanding of functions from your algebra
class, we need to provide a formal framework in order to simplify your
understanding of what a function can and can't do.  In this section we
will talk about using the functions that others have made for us to
use.  In the next chapter we will teach you how to create your own
functions. 



Functions are mini-programs
---------------------------

Functions are a special type of variable.  Where a *Variable* stores a
value, a *Function* stores a computation. When we use a variable in an expression,
the computer interprets the 
variable as the value it represents. When we use a function, the
stored computation is executed. The computer interprets the function
as the result of that computation. 

..  Need picture here of before and after code

The act of using the computation of a function is **calling the
function**.  You can think of it as the interpreter summoning the code
in order to perform an execution.  In this way, we can think of
functions as mini programs that use the IPO algorithm. Some
programming languages even call functions, *subprograms*. When we call
a function we must keep track of three things. 
	
	1. What input do I need?
	2. What will the function do with that input?
	3. What will the function return as an output?

Function Input : Arguments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
While there are functions that do not have any inputs, most function
require at least one input.  The inputs to a function are called
*arguments*.  Arguments can be values, variables or even other functions. 

	.. sourcecode:: python3
	        :linenos: 	

		>>> x = sin(3)
		>>> print (x)
		0.14112000806
		>>> y = asin(x)
		>>> print (y)
		0.14159265359
		>>> z = sin( asin(.5) )
		>>> print (z)
		0.5

In line 1 we see that ``3`` is the arguement, input, to the sin function. 
In line 4 and line 7 we see a varible and a function respectivly used as an arguement
for a function. 

Many functions have multiple arguments.  Multiple arguments are
separated by commas in the function call.  For instance, the
''pow'' function takes two parameters, the base and the
exponent. Think of the argument list as the casting for a play.  In
the play Romeo and Juliet, the first slot goes to the person that
plays Romeo. The second slot goes to the person that plays Juliet.  If
there was a function called ''doPlay'', ''doPlay("mark","jill")''
would cast Mark in the role of Romeo and Jill in the role of Juliet.

The play would be much different if the director called
``doPlay("jill","mark")`` or even ``doPlay("tim","mark")``.  If this
is the director's intent, the play will have an interesting story to
tell.  If not, the director will be embarrassed. Observe the effects
when the pow function is called without thinking about the ordering or
the inputs. 


	.. sourcecode:: python3
	
		>>> print pow(3,4)
		81.0
		>>> print pow(4,3)
		64.0


.. index:: argument, calling a function, subprogram

Function Output : Return
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All functions have to return something.  In most cases,
the returned value is the result of the calculation performed.  For
instance calling ``cos(0)``, would return ``1``. We call functions 
to get the results of those calculations. The 2 most common uses
of calling functions, are to store the result to a variable to print
it out (Line 3) or to use the result of the function inside another function(line 2).
 

	.. sourcecode:: python3
	        :linenos:
	
		>>> x = sin(3)
		>>> y = asin(x)
		>>> print (y)
		0.14159265359

While all functions must return something, there are many functions
that do not return anything useful. This seems odd, but these
functions tend to be associated with more complex structures or provide
output in some other fashion.  At the end of this chapter we will work
with many functions that do not return anything useful, but instead
draw graphical output. 

So if a function doesn't have anything useful to return what should it
do?  Python has a special Type called **None**. None is the
representation of nothing.   When a function has nothing to say, it
returns None. If you try to print it out you will see the string
``None``. Otherwise, any actions you do with None, will raise an
error. As a rule of thumb, when you call a function, make sure that
you understand what will be returned. 

.. index:: return, None

Modules
-------

In order to go further we are presented with a dilemma.  How can we
use functions, if we haven't made any functions yet? The good news is
that the Python language comes with many **modules** filled with
functions ready to use. A **module** is a file containing Python
definitions and statements intended for use in other Python
programs. There are many Python modules that come with Python as part
of the **standard library**.  

There are two ways to retrieve functions from a module. The first
technique is preferred. To import the math module, which contains all
of the calculator functions, type ``import math`` at the top of your
script.  Then if you want to use a function from the module you type ``math.``
before the function. For instance to find the sine of 2, you
would type ``math.sin(2)``. 

	.. sourcecode:: python3
	
		import math
		print math.sin(2)
		
A second technique exists and is used as a time-saving technique.  If
you will repeatedly use a function, typing out the module name every
time you want to use the function can be cumbersome.  The alternative
form would look like this ``from math import sin``.  This command
places the function sin into your file.  To find the sin of 2, you
would just type ``sin(2)``. 

	.. sourcecode:: python3
	
		from math import sin
		print sin(2)

We can go even further with this second technique.  If we need to use
many functions from a particular module, we can load all of the
functions using the wildcard ``*`` in place of the function.  It would
look like this: ``form math import *``.    

	.. sourcecode:: python3
	
		from math import sin
		print sin(2)
		print cos(2)
		print ceil(45.6)


Math module
-----------

The math module contains all of the functions you would expect from a
calculator.  Rather than write out everything the module can do, this
is a perfect time for you to learn how to find out for yourself.  If
you are running IDLE right now, click on Help->Python
Docs. Alternatively you can find the documentation online at
http://docs.python.org/.  On the first page, scroll down and look for
Global Module Index.  When you click on it, you will about a hundred
different  modules that are part of Python.  Scroll down and click on
math.  Read the trigonometric functions section.  Go ahead I'll wait. 


.. image:: illustrations/waitForWork.png
   :alt: picture of clock


Recall that there are three things that you need to know about a
function.  These descriptions will answer those three questions. I'll
include one function description below to reference. The first thing
we see is the *function signature*, the name of the function and the
parameters that it needs.  When a function is named properly, you can
almost figure out  what the function will do.  But read further, see
how each of those descriptions tells you what the function returns and
how the parameters influence that result.  


.. glossary::

	math.acos(x) 
	
		Return the arc cosine of x, in radians.


Go back and read the rest of the math help page.  I would recommend reading
the function signatures first.  If you can tell what the function
does, skip the description and go to the next one.  Otherwise, read
the description.  Your goal right now is not to memorize the module
libraries but to learn how to read module libraries and to feel
comfortable looking up functions.  If you are curious about what other
modules will be important, I recommend looking up the random and time
modules.  Sometimes knowing a tool exists can dramatically change the
approach you take to a problem.

Pygame module
--------------

We will spend the rest of this chapter learning some basics about the
Pygame module.  Pygame is bare-bones library designed for creating
video games that can run on several different systems.  We will make
use of Pygame throughout the rest of the book, so taking some time to
get the basics will pay off. Each time we revisit Pygame we will
learn more functions or learn new ways to use the functions we have
learned. 

If you don't have Pygame installed on your system, you will need to download it from 
http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml.  At the time of writing this,
Pygame is not officially supported by Python 3. (It is close but you
will need to fake it).  Until that date, go ahead and down load Python
2 and Pygame to set them up on your system.



Overview of Pygame graphics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Computer graphics have some underlying realities that shape the way in
which we interact with them. That reality is that images are composed
in a 2 dimensional grid of **pixels**.  Each pixel has one color,
composed of red,green, and blue. Pixels also have a location in the 2
dimensional grid.  Like the grid you used in your algebra class, each
point is an x,y coordinate. The x's start at 0 on the left and
increase as you go farther right.  Unlike the coordinate system you
learned in algebra, y's start at 0 at the top and increase as you go
down the screen. 

.. image:: illustrations/coordSystem.png
	:alt: graphics coordinate systems have the origin in the upper left hand corner.

Unlike most other modules, Pygame requires many start up operations
before it can run many of the other functions. For this reason the
``init()`` function should be the first Pygame function you call in
any Pygame program.  Similarly,  You should call the ``quit()``
function when your program closes. 

.. sourcecode:: python3

		import pygame
		
		pygame.init()
		#drawing stuff goes here
		# could be a lot of it...
		pygame.quit()

		
Supporting types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We need to learn some new types before we can call the functions that
will draw our pictures. 

Color
++++++

Each Pixel has a color and many functions will use a color as an arguement.
Color is a type, just like int, float, or string.
Since Color is more complex, we have to
use a function to create a Color variable. To create a Color, you need
to provide 3 parameters: red,green,blue. Each of these parameters
indicates how much of each light color , red,green,blue is present in
the final color. Values for the parameters must be integers between 0
and 255. There are many sites that list the red, green, and blue components of common colors.  Here is one site http://www.web-source.net/216_color_chart.htm.

Many Pygame developers will create variables to represent
each color at the beginning of their code so they can reuse them as
needed. Since the variables will not be changed during the program, it
is a convention to capitalize them (not a rule though). 

.. sourcecode:: python3

	import pygame
	
	pygame.init()
	RED_COLOR = pygame.Color(255,0,0)
	GOLDENROD_COLOR = pygame.Color(218, 165, 32)
	BLACK_COLOR = pygame.Color(0,0,0)
	
	#use colors
	input("press enter to exit") #use raw_input() for python 2
	pygame.quit()

Tuple Type
+++++++++++

Each pixel has an x,y coordinate where it will be placed.  Rather than
pass around two variables, Pygame wants to deal with x and y in the
same variable.  To do this Pygame uses **tuples**.  Tuples are
**Sequences** of values.  They are used to pass around data. You can
form a tuple by using ``,`` to separate values.  It is a convention to
also place tuples in parentheses when you define the variable.  When a
tuple is printed it will be displayed in parenthesis.

.. sourcecode:: python3

	x = 10
	y = 45
	centerPoint = (x,y)
	
	#another way to do it
	samePoint = x,y
	
	#a more direct approach
	againPoint = (10,45)
	

The final thing
to keep in mind is that tuples are part of the python language.  You
will find several uses of tuples in the future.



.. index:: tuple, sequence	


Font Type
+++++++++

Font is the description of how text should look when it is drawn. To
create a font object we must call the Font function and describe what
font and what size the font should be. 

    .. sourcecode:: python3
        
        # Instantiate 16 point Courier font to draw text.
        myFont = pygame.font.SysFont('Courier', 16) 
      


	  
	  
Surface Type
++++++++++++

Pygame uses surfaces objects to represent a 2 dimensional grid of
pixels.  Surfaces are the workhorse of Pygame to draw things to the
screen. There are many ways to create Surfaces. Here are three
functions to create a surface object.  As you learn more about Pygame,
you will find other ways to create a surface object.  The first
function (line 8) creates the window, the second function (line 11) loads an image
from a file, and the third function (line 16) will place a text message on a
surface. 

.. sourcecode:: python3
        :linenos:

	import pygame
	
	pygame.init()
	
	GOLDENROD_COLOR = pygame.Color(218, 165, 32)
	
	#window is a surface. If I change window, the screen will change
  	windowSurf = pygame.display.set_mode((640,480))
	
	#head image is a surface that has one image 
	headSurf = pygame.image.load("bradshaw.jpg")

	
	# Instantiate 16 point Courier font to draw text.
        myFont = pygame.font.SysFont('Courier', 16) 
	fontSurf = myFont.render("We're learning PyGame",False,GOLDENROD_COLOR)
	
	
	pygame.quit()

	
Drawing to the Screen
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

we are almost to the point where we can draw things to the screen. We
have two ways to draw.  First we can **blit** one surface onto another
surface. If you have images or fonts this is the only way to get them
to show up. The second technique is to use the draw functions to draw
graphics primitives (circles, polygons, lines, rectangles, ellipses) to a surface.

Blitting is the act of copying the pixels from one surface and placing
them on another surface. The notation to do this is a bit odd,
``destinationSurfaceObj.blit(sourceSurfaceObject,destPoint)``.  Recall
that surfaces are complex types (commonly called a class).  These
types have not only data but functions built into them.  ``blit()`` is
part of Surface, (in much the same way that sin is part of the math
module.  We will explore these complex types at more depth later in
the class, but for now we'll settle for a surface understanding.)

Drawing is done by functions.    As you did with the math module, you will need to look up the functions.
You can find all of the draw funcitons here 
http://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/draw.html. 
Each function requires different parameters. 
You'll be able to find the necessary arguments to make your programs work.  
.. MKB FIXME 
Rect shows up in several of the argument lists. You can use a 4-tuple, a tuple with 4 elements.  
The first two coordinates are the top-left x,y coordinate.
The last two coordinates are the width and the height of the rectangle.  There is a Rect type, that will be useful in the future but is overkill right now, http://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/rect.html.

The final step to draw to the screen is to place a command to update,
``pygame.display.update()``.  Until you do this, none of the changes
you have done to the windowSurface will show up to the screen.  Another
**side effect** is that the surface will be wiped clean.  This will
become important when we discuss animation.  For now we will only look
at creating an image up on the screen.  I'll share a small example
program that will demonstrate many of the topics we discussed. 


	.. sourcecode:: python3
	
		import pygame

		BG_COLOR   = pygame.Color(255,255,255)
		BODY_COLOR = pygame.Color(0,100,0)
		FLESH_COLOR = pygame.Color(255,125,64)
		BLACK_COLOR = pygame.Color(0,0,0)

		pygame.init()
		#create window
		windowSurface = pygame.display.set_mode((640,480))
		pygame.display.set_caption("Bradshaw the Robot")
		windowSurface.fill(BG_COLOR)

		#body
		pygame.draw.ellipse(windowSurface,BLACK_COLOR, \
							  (315,125,150,260),0)
		pygame.draw.ellipse(windowSurface,BODY_COLOR, \
							  (320,130,140,250),0)
		#face
		headSurface = pygame.image.load("bradshaw.jpg")
		windowSurface.blit(headSurface,(300,0))

		#arms
		pygame.draw.rect(windowSurface,BLACK_COLOR, \
							  (455,225,30,110),0)
		pygame.draw.rect(windowSurface,BODY_COLOR, \
							  (460,230,20,100),0)
		pygame.draw.rect(windowSurface,BLACK_COLOR, \
							  (295,225,30,110),0)
		pygame.draw.rect(windowSurface,BODY_COLOR, \
							  (300,230,20,100),0)
		#hands
		pygame.draw.circle(windowSurface,FLESH_COLOR,\
						   (310,330),15,0)
		pygame.draw.circle(windowSurface,FLESH_COLOR,\
						   (470,330),15,0)
		#text
		font = pygame.font.SysFont("Courier",24)
		messageSurface = font.render("I am not a robot",False,BLACK_COLOR)
		windowSurface.blit(messageSurface,(10,10))

                #save picture to a file
                pygame.image.save(windowSurface,"robot.png")

		pygame.display.update()            
		#for python 3, use input instead
		raw_input("Press enter to exit")
		pygame.quit()


		
You can run the code above, substitute a picture of yourself in place
of bradshaw.jpg. Make sure your picture is in the same directory as
your code.  If all goes well you should see something like the
following image.
